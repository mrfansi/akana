# Product Requirement Document: Akana Task Management App

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To create a collaborative task management application, "Akana" (inspired by Asana), that empowers teams with diverse roles to manage projects efficiently, track progress seamlessly, and foster effective communication.

**Goals:**

* Develop a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform using Laravel, React (with Inertia.js), and ShadCN UI.
* Implement core task management features including task assignment, Kanban boards, role-based dashboards, and timeline views.
* Enable real-time collaboration and updates using Laravel Reverb.
* Provide a clean, professional, and interactive user interface that is responsive across devices.
* Support structured collaboration for teams with specific roles: UI/UX Designers, UX Researchers, Front-End Developers, Back-End Developers, DevOps, and Database Administrators.

## 2. Target Audience & User Roles

The application is designed for project teams requiring structured collaboration. Key user roles include:

* **Project Manager (Implicit Role/Admin):** Oversees projects, manages team members, assigns tasks, and tracks overall progress.
* **UI/UX Designer:** Responsible for designing user interfaces and experiences. Tasks may include wireframing, prototyping, creating mockups, and UI asset creation.
* **UX Researcher:** Focuses on understanding user needs and behaviors. Tasks may involve user interviews, usability testing, survey creation, and persona development.
* **Front-End Developer:** Implements the user interface and client-side logic. Tasks include translating designs into code, building interactive components, and ensuring responsiveness.
* **Back-End Developer:** Develops server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions. Tasks involve building application features, ensuring data integrity, and managing server performance.
* **DevOps Engineer:** Manages infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and application monitoring. Tasks include CI/CD setup, server configuration, and ensuring application uptime.
* **Database Administrator (DBA):** Designs, implements, and maintains the database. Tasks include schema design, query optimization, backups, and security.
* **Team Member (General):** A generic role for users who participate in projects without a specialized technical role, contributing to tasks and discussions.

## 3. User Stories

*(This section will be expanded with detailed user stories for each role and feature.)*

**Example User Stories:**

* **As a Project Manager, I want to create a new project and invite team members so that we can start collaborating.**
* **As a UI/UX Designer, I want to upload design mockups to a task so that developers can access them easily.**
* **As a Front-End Developer, I want to see tasks assigned to me on my dashboard so that I know what to work on.**
* **As a Back-End Developer, I want to be notified in real-time when a task status changes so that I am aware of project progress.**
* **As a Team Member, I want to view tasks on a Kanban board so that I can visualize workflow and progress.**
* **As a DevOps Engineer, I want a dashboard view of system health and deployment status.**
* **As a UX Researcher, I want to create tasks for usability testing sessions and link reports.**
